    "DRY \n",
    "This stands for Don't Repeat Yourself! It means that any part of your system that might ever need to change should have a single place where you can make the change. Don't copy blocks of code to wherever you need them in your program: write a function and call it from each of those places. Don't define your data tables in your database, and also in your code: find a way (like the Django models.py file) to define your data one place and use that definition to generate both the database and the code that uses the DB.\n",
    "No magic constants. \n",
    "This is a special case of DRY. It is very tempting, when coding your NYU scheduling app, to write code assuming there are two (major) semesters per year. This will be fine... until NYU adopts a tri-mester system. Instead, define a constant NUM_SEMS = 2. You might get away with writing day_of_week = day mod 7, since that number probably will never change. But you really ought to write hour_of_day = hour mod CLOCK_PERIOD, since both 12 and 24 hour timekeeping methods exist.\n",
    "Make functions do one job. \n",
    "Funcitons that perform a single job are simpler to understand, easier to change or eliminate, and render the overall system more comprehensible. For instance, if the county writes a tax program with a function called calc_taxes, it would be natural to eliminate that function if the job is later passed off to a microservice running on the cloud. But, if the coders also happened to include the code to clear tax liens (county claims against the property for unpaid taxes) in the same function... Oops! No one who ever had a tax lien can sell their property, because the lien never gets cleared.\n",
    "Keep functions short. \n",
    "This is related to the previous principle, but focuses on the size of the one job that should be done. A function named handle_yearly_taxes() is doing one job, but probably way to big a job. It would make more sense to have create_tax_roll(), calculate_taxes(), send_bills(), record_payments(), and perhaps more.\n",
    "Format and indent properly. \n",
    "Different languages have different conventions for how to name variables (camelCase, with_underscores, MixedCase, and so on), how to space operators, where to put braces, and so on. You should follow those conventions, unless there is a strong reason not to. Consistent indentation is especially important: it allows a reader of your code to easily line up blocks of control. Irregular indentation is a significant source of bugs, as people modifying the code will make mistakes, for example, about which else goes with which if.\n",
    "Comment judiciously. \n",
    "Code should contain some comments, especially things like docstrings for classes that can be extracted to produce a guide to the system, and comments explaining what particularly tricky or unusual bits of code do. But commenting is no substitute for writing clear, readable code in the first place! The best explanation of what your code does is, if you write it correctly, your code itself. Remember that we could, and once did, write code just as a sequence of 1s and 0s. And all higher-level languages need to be translated into such code in the end. So why bother with C, Java, or Python? These languages exist for humans, not for computers: they make it easier for us to understand and reason about what a program will do. The upshot: you should look at your code as being every bit as much about communicating to humans as about directing a computer.\n",
    "Go for the golden mean in naming. \n",
    "Sometimes, names of functions and variables can be way too cryptic: there are examples in the widely used CLRS Algorithm book where I have found as many as six single-letter variable names used at once. On the other hand, naming a function something like take_input_of_employee_w2_and_calculate_employee_tax_rate() is absurdly long: please remember, other programmers will have to type your function names in order to call your functions! Such immense names also make it extremely difficult to stay within guidelines like PEP 8's dictum of \"no lines longer than 79 characters.\" A more reasonable middle ground might be something like calc_tax_rate(), where an employee's W2 might be a parameter for the function.\n",
    "Test, test, test! \n",
    "Write an automated test to go with every program or new feature you write. Test as completely by hand as you can: don't just test that your code fetches the data from the DB correctly: test that it still works properly if there is no data in the DB, or, indeed, if there is no DB!

    "\"Working software is the primary measure of progress.\" -- The Agile Manifesto\n",
    "\n",
    " Lesson 1: DevOps as Software Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Lecture 1: Some DevOps History\n",
    "As software engineers, our aim should be to deliver programs to our users that perform the tasks they need that software to perform. The whole field of software engineering has centered around how to achieve that goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "One attempt to achieve it was the waterfall model of software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The waterfall model\n",
    "But the waterfall model produced many failures: death marches, instances of the ninety-ninety rule, small matter of programming issues, planning fallacies, and many more such problems. And we can offer a sound diagnosis of why so many waterfall projects failed: the model assumed that all knowledge about a project could be captured by a small group of expert \"analysts\" right at the start of the project, and the job of the rest of the people involved was just to follow the instructions of those experts, and not to think for themselves. In short, the waterfall model was a species of Taylorism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, some software projects using the waterfall model succeeded. But it turns out that most successful software projects, over many decades, instead followed the \"UNIX philosophy\", where development projects sought to quickly achieve an MVP, and then proceeded to improve that initial product with incremental changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recognition of this fact lead, over time, to the formulation of the Lean and Agile development methods. These methods focused on rapidly creating and releasing to users incremental improvements in a software. (Please take the time to read the Wikipedia pages linked to above on Lean and Agile: you are responsible for knowing that material.) The advantages of small improvements to a software product, released frequently, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Value is delivered to the users quickly, rather than waiting for \"release 2.0\" for the users to get a hold of the features they need.\n",
    "Small batches can more easily be tested and verified as working properly.\n",
    "If a small release contains an error, it is easier to roll it back than it is to roll back a major release.\n",
    "The \"feedback loop\" between users and programmers is shortened, allowing programmers to learn about users' needs more rapidly, and respond more quickly to them.\n",
    "Greater programmer satisfaction, as programmers can regularly see the value of their work to their users.\n",
    "As development teams adopted Lean and Agile methods, they often became capable of producing production-ready software on a daily basis, or even more frequently. (For instance, Amazon releases software into production once every 11 seconds, on average.) But this created a problem: managing software in production environments was traditionally the job of operations, not of the developers. And operations viewed its job as slowing the pace of releases, because releases meant bugs, crashes, and other problems operations had to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "How could this gulf between development and operations be narrowed? A few forward-thinking operations people saw a way to reconcile the aims of development and operations: operations itself had to become Lean and Agile! In particular, rather than hand-provisioning operations infrastructure, operations team members had to themselves become coders, and apply the full toolkit of Lean and Agile methods to operations: incremental changes, automated testing, source code control, automated builds, and so on. One of those operations people, Patrick Debois, named a conference DevOpsDays, and from that seed, the term \"DevOps\" spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the term \"DevOps\" is an umbrella beneath which reside a large number of methods and tools. We can better understand why each of the areas we will studying falls under \"DevOps\" when we comprehend how they contribute to the DevOps goal of delivering useful and correct software to users as rapidly and as often as possible. Let's look at how the main areas of DevOps contribute to this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Testers cannot test successfully unless they are part of the production process from day one: thus, continuous testing.\n",
    "Operations cannot successfully deploy constantly evolving products unless deployment itself becomes a software product capable of swiftly evolving: thus, software as infrastructure.\n",
    "The \"business\" stakeholders in the product can't ensure it is meeting business needs unless they are continually engaged: thus continual interaction between the engineers and the \"business people.\"\n",
    "Why is \"business\" in scare quotes above? \n",
    "\"We are not developing software. We are doing something larger and software is just part of the solution.\" -- Tom Poppendieck\n",
    "How new versions of a piece of software impact the end users cannot be determined without continual feedback from those users, thus:\n",
    "Incremental development, which means developers work on small batches and can easily change course based on feedback;\n",
    "Continuous deployment, allowing users to comment on the work done in those small batches; and\n",
    "Continuous monitoring, so that problems using the product become known right away.\n",
    "At this point in our course, you should read the Wikipedia page on DevOps.\n",
    "\n",
    " Lesson 2: My DevOps Story\n",
    "Or how, being weaned on nutritious Bell Labs commonsense, and having dined on Oakeshott's critique of rationalism, I was ready to digest the DevOps feast.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began my career as a software engineer working on MS-DOS computers in the mid-1980s. But before the decade was over, I had begun working on UNIX platforms. As I came to appreciate the elegance of the UNIX programming environment, I sought out the writings of the people who had been instrumental in its creation. This was the tremendous group of software engineers assembled in Bell Labs from the late 1960s through the early 1980s, including Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, Bjarne Stroustrup, Jon Bentley, and P.J. Plauger. From them I learned a pragmatic, incremental style of developing software. Rather than pursuing some grand, abstract vision, I learned to deliver minimal but working software to users as regularly as possible, and to learn from user feedback what further features needed to be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX and its discontents\n",
    "By the 1990s, I had learned enough that I felt ready to make my own contributions to this literature, writing on the benefits of symbolic interfaces, pioneering intranets as a way of delivering in-house software, touting infrastructure as code, describing generic client-server interfaces, stressing the basics of OOP, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequently, in a decade away from software engineering, I conducted extensive studies on rationalism. These studies prepared me to understand development methods like the waterfall model as examples of \"dreaming of systems so perfect that no one will need to be good\"* -- these practitioners were practicing \"rationalism in software engineering.\" Or, to put it in my colleague Nassim Taleb's terms, these systems were designed to be robust, impervious to change. (Consider the desire to \"lock down\" the software's feature set in the requirements phase of the waterfall model.) What was needed instead were systems that were antifragile, and actually thrived on change.\n",

    "Thus, when I returned to software engineering and came across the DevOps movement, my experience was not one of meeting someone brand new, but of re-acquainting myself with an old friend who was sporting a new look, and had learned some fancy new tricks since we had last met. In particular, the DevOps approach does not try to ensure design is 100% complete before any code is written: an impossible, rationalist dream. The DevOps approach does not attempt to ensure all software leaving a developer's hands is bug-free: again, an impossible, rationalist dream. And it does not attempt to ensure that all released software is 100% crash-free and secure. Instead, the DevOps approach recognizes that humans are fallible and errors will occur, and so stresses fast recovery from errors and a low-blame culture that emphasizes learning from errors rather than punishing transgressors. So, for instance, rather than blaming the programmer who released a piece of buggy code into production, the DevOps approach asks, \"What test haven't we written that would have caught that bug before release?\"\n",

    " Lesson 3: DevOps and the Division of Labor\n",
    "\n",
    "My talk at StackOverflow\n",
    "Leonard E. Read began his famous essay “I, Pencil” (here) by noting:\n",
    "\n",
    "I, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe, a claim I shall attempt to prove… Simple? Yet, not a single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me. This sounds fantastic, doesn't it? Especially when it is realized that there are about one and one-half billion of my kind produced in the U.S.A. each year.\n",
    "Read goes on to list just a few of the many, many people who contribute to the making of a “simple” pencil: loggers, miners, makers of chain saws, hemp growers, the manufacturers of railroads and railroad cars, millworkers, producers of precision assembly-line machines, the harvesters of canola seed, farmers growing castor beans, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Read is praising in his essay are the benefits of the division of labor, the economic process through which a human community, by dividing up tasks and “assigning” various members to specialize in each task, can greatly increase its output. (I put “assigning” in scare quotes because, in a market economy, for the most part people are not literally assigned to tasks, but instead choose their roles in the division of labor based upon their talents and the prevailing compensation for each possible role they could fill.) The benefits of the division of labor were, of course, recognized at least as far back as Plato and Xenophon. As Plato put it in The Republic, “Well then, how will our state supply these (physical) needs? It will need a farmer, a builder, and a weaver, and also, I think, a shoemaker and one or two others to provide for our bodily needs. So that the minimum state would consist of four or five men.” And Adam Smith famously expounded upon those benefits in The Wealth of Nations, writing “The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour” (The Wealth of Nations). Smith goes on to describe the production of pins, a task at which a single person, not specialized at the task, “could scarce, perhaps, with his utmost industry, make one pin in a day, and certainly could not make twenty” (same source as above). But, when ten workers took on specialized tasks, with the help of specialized machinery, though “they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day” (same source), with the result that each worker produced several thousand times the number of pins per day as would have been possible without the division of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 20th century, this method of increasing productivity was pushed to its limits. Tasks were broken down to the extent that workers with minimal skills could be assigned simple, highly repetitive actions, and perform them with almost no knowledge of what anyone else on the assembly line was up to. Although this led to higher output of standardized products, the disadvantages of extending the division of labor to this extent were not overlooked. Karl Marx noted that the extensive division of labor alienated the worker from the product he was producing: someone who spends all day tightening a particular lug nut may be little able to associate what they do with “making a car.” But even Adam Smith, who, as we have seen, praised the effects of the division of labor, commented:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations, frequently to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible to become for a human creature to become. (http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN20.html#V.1.178)\n",
    "Smith is pointing out a general problem with the extensive division of labor, but there is a much more particular problem, which only came to prominence in the recent days of increasing automation and increasing demand for innovative and customized products: the sort of mindless, production-line division of tasks common in mid-20th-century factories created a workforce downright discouraged from thinking about how their work fit into the production process as a whole, or how alterations in other parts they did not directly make might affect their own task. Such a holistic view was only supposed to be required of the engineers who designed new products or who designed the factory processes that would produce those new products. As in a planned, socialist economy, all knowledge about the product and the production process would be concentrated at the top of a pyramid of work, and those below the peak were to just mindlessly follow the orders of those knowledge commissars.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major problem with this approach is that as products become more complicated and the pace of innovation increases, no single mind, or even a small group of minds, is capable of grasping all of the interconnections between the different parts of those complex products, and thus, cannot foresee how an innovation supposedly concerning only one part will actually have ripple effects on many other apparently separate production tasks. This fact was realized quite early at Toyota, and led to the invention of the Toyota Production System, the forerunner of Lean Software Development. As Mary and Tom Poppendieck note in Implementing Lean Software Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "Toyota’s real innovation is its ability to harness the intellect of “ordinary” employees. Successful lean initiatives must be based first and foremost on a deep respect for every person in the company, especially the “ordinary” people who make the product or pound out the code. (pp. 124-125)\n",
    "As important as these ideas were in factory production, their importance is even greater in the world of software development, where production is always production of a novel product: otherwise, one would simply buy or rent an existing software product, which is almost always a lower cost venture than “rolling your own.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In such an environment, it is simply not possible to assign the “workers” (programmers) a simple, repetitive task, and expect them to achieve decent results without at least some understanding of the overall product design, as well as an understanding of how their particular “part” integrates with the other parts of the product as a whole. In such a situation, worker obedience no longer “works.” A manager cannot tell a software engineer working on a product of even moderate complexity to just follow the manager’s orders: the programmer can bring production to a halt simply by asking, “OK, what line of code should I write next?”\n",
    "\n",
    "But further: no knowledge worker producing an even moderately complex product can do his work properly without his understanding of his part in the production process evolving in continuous interaction with the evolving understanding of all of the other knowledge workers producing the product: one such worker gaining a better understanding of the nature of her component simply must convey that understanding to all other workers upon whom the changes in her component have an impact, and that set of workers typically encompasses almost everyone working on the product. As the Disciplined Agile Framework has it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Enterprise awareness is one of the key principles behind the Disciplined Agile (DA) framework. The observation is that DA teams work within your organization’s enterprise ecosystem, as do all other teams. There are often existing systems currently in production and minimally your solution shouldn’t impact them. Better yet your solution will hopefully leverage existing functionality and data available in production. You will often have other teams working in parallel to your team, and you may wish to take advantage of a portion of what they’re doing and vice versa. Your organization may be working towards business or technical visions which your team should contribute to. A governance strategy exists which hopefully enhances what your team is doing. (http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/enterpriseawareness/)\n",
    "The various aspects of Agile / Lean / DevOps production follow from recognizing these realities concerning knowledge workers cooperating to create innovative products. Programmers cannot do their jobs in isolation: thus, the practice of continuous integration, which quickly exposes mutual misunderstandings of how one person’s work impacts that of others. Testers cannot test successfully, without introducing large delays in deployment, unless they are part of the production process from day one: thus, continuous testing, guaranteeing that product flaws are exposed and fixed at the earliest moment possible. Operations cannot successfully deploy constantly evolving products unless deployment itself becomes a software product capable of evolving as fast as the products of the developers: thus, software as infrastructure. The “business” stakeholders in the product cannot ensure the product is really meeting business needs unless they are continually engaged in the development process: thus continual interaction between the engineers and the “business people.” How new versions of a piece of software impact the end users cannot be determined without continual feedback from those users: thus, incremental development, which means developer work on small batches and can easily change course; continuous deployment, allowing end users to comment on the work done in those small batches; and continuous monitoring, so that any problems using the product become known almost as soon as they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above realities, a rigid division of labor hinders businesses from responding agilely to changing market conditions while producing software. If workers are confined to narrow silos based on job title, the interaction between the many components of a complex piece of software must be defined from the top down, and this restriction will result in a very limited capacity to deviate from an initially defined pattern of interaction. In Disciplined Agile, it is noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "IT departments are complex adaptive organizations.  What we mean by that is that the actions of one team will affect the actions of another team, and so on and so on.  For example, the way that your agile delivery team works will have an effect on, and be affected by, any other team that you interact with.  If you’re working with your operations teams, perhaps as part of your overall DevOps strategy, then each of those teams will need to adapt the way they work to collaborate effectively with one another.  Each team will hopefully learn from the other and improve the way that they work. (Disciplined Agile)\n",
    "Let us consider a realistic change that might hit a project mid-stream, and just a few of the areas it might impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was once developing an option-trading package for a team of traders. At first, we were only getting quotes for options from a single exchange. The traders realized that they wanted instead to see the best bid and ask from every exchange, which meant we needed to get quotes from four exchanges, not one. This might seem to be a specification change with a narrow scope: just add three more price feeds to the application. Who would this concern beyond the programmer who would be adding the feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, for one, it would concern the team supporting the price server: this was going to quadruple the load this application would place on it. It was also going to impact the order server: that server had to be prepared to send orders out to the proper exchanges. Oh, and the testing team had better be prepared to simulate quotes coming in from four sources, not one. Also, the monitoring team would have to detect if there was a lag on quotes arriving from four sources, not one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or consider the patterns and tales from Michael T. Nygard’s book, Release It!. Continually, in Nygard’s stories, solving a problem in a sophisticated web operation involves a wide range of both technical and business knowledge. For instance, in terms of designing “circuit breakers” that limit the impact of the failure of one component, Nygard notes that deciding what to do when a circuit breaker trips is not merely a technical decision, but involves a deep understanding of business processes: “Should a retail system accept an order if it can’t confirm availability of the customer’s items? What about if it can’t verify the customer’s credit card or shipping address?” (p. 97) Later in the book, a retail system went down entirely on Black Friday, costing his client about a million dollars an hour in sales. Fixing the problem involved understanding the functioning of the frontend of the online store, the order management system, and the scheduling system, and the interactions of the three.\n",
    "\n",
    "A software engineer who thinks of his job narrowly, as just being responsible for writing the code to do the task he is told the code should do, is not going to be thinking of the multiple other areas this change would affect. And a higher-level designer is unlikely to know enough of the details of all of these areas to fully understand the impact of this change: the best bet for being able to successfully respond to this changed business requirement is for the people working in each specialization also to have a vision of the overall system, an understanding of how other specialized areas function, and to have robust communication channels open between the various specialties: in other words, to break down the silo walls produced by a rigid division of labor, and embrace agile development principles. Or, as said in Disciplined Agile:\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to succeed delivery teams must often work with people outside of the team, such as enterprise architects, operations engineers, governance people, data management people, and many others.  For agile/lean delivery teams to be effective these people must also work in an agile/lean manner. ( Disciplined Agile)\n",
    " Lesson 4: Software Development as a Discovery Procedure\n",
    "Nobel-Prize-winning economist F.A. Hayek was one of the most significant social theorists of the 20th century. He did important work on the theory of the business cycle, on monetary theory, on the theory of capital, on the informational role of market prices, on the nature of complex phenomena, and on the importance of group selection in evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hayek's work has important insights to offer those advancing Lean / Agile / DevOps ideas for IT. Here I will focus on his paper \"Competition as a Discovery Procedure,\" and note how similar Hayek's vision for the role of competition in the market is to the Agile understanding of the importance of the \"development\" part of the phrase \"software development.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That essay of Hayek's was written in response to the model of \"perfect competition\" that had come to dominate economics in the middle of the 20th century. In that model, \"competition\" meant a state of affairs in which each market participant already knew every relevant detail about the market in which they participated, and thus simply \"accepted\" a price that, somehow, mysteriously emerged from the \"given data\" of their market. In such a situation no actual competition, as it is commonly understood, really occurs: every \"competitor\" already knows what product to offer, what price to charge, and simply passively accepts their situation as it stands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the waterfall model of software development simply assumes that what has to be discovered, in the process of software development, is already fully known at the start of the process. Instead of correctly understanding development as a process through which the analysts, coders, testers, documenters, and users come to a mutual understanding of what the software should really be like, the waterfall model posits that certain experts can fully envision what the final product should be, right at the start of the process. \"Software development\" then consists of these experts drawing up a document analogous to one of the \"five-year plans\" of the Soviet Union, detailing how all of the other \"participants\" should work, according to the experts' plan. No further input is needed as far as what the software being \"developed\" should actually do. But in reality, as Eric Evans notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we set out to write software, we never know enough. Knowledge on the project is fragmented, scattered among many people and documents, and it's mixed with other information so that we don't even know which bits of knowledge we really need. Domains that seem less technically daunting can be deceiving: we don't realize how much we don't know. This ignorance leads us to make false assumptions. (Evans, p. 15)\n",
    "Hayek, describing the dependence of economists on the perfect competition model, admits:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to defend economists against the charge that for some 40 or 50 years they have been discussing competition on assumptions that, if they were true of the real world, would make it wholly uninteresting and useless. If anyone really knew all about what economic theory calls the data, competition would indeed be a very wasteful method of securing adjustment to these facts. (Hayek, 179)\n",
    "He goes on to write:\n",
    "\n",
    "In sports or in examinations, no less than in the world of government contracts or prizes for poetry, it would clearly be pointless to arrange for competition, if we were certain beforehand who would do best... I propose to consider competition as a procedure for the discovery of such facts as, without resort to it, would not be known to anyone... (Hayek, 179)\n",
    "This, I suggest, is quite analogous to software development: it would be pointless to engage in such a time-consuming, mentally challenging activity if we knew in advance what software \"would do best.\" We engage in software development to discover \"such facts as, without resort to it, would not be known to anyone.\" It is only when we put our interface in front of real users that we find out if it really is \"intuitive.\" It is only when we confront our theoretical calculations with the real data that we know if we got them right. It is only when we put our database out to meet real loads that we can tell if its performance is adequate. We can only tell if our CDN design meets our goals when it actually has to deliver content. None of this means that we should not plan as much as possible, in advance, to make sure our software is up to snuff, just that how much is possible is quite limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hayek highlights the true value of competition in the following passage:\n",
    "\n",
    "[C]ompetition is valuable only because, and so far as, its results are unpredictable and on the whole different from those which anyone has, or could have, deliberately aimed at... We do not know the facts we hope to discover means of competition, we can never ascertain how effective it has been discovering those facts that might be discovered... The peculiarity of competition -- which it has in common with scientific method -- is that its performance cannot be tested in particular instances where it is significant... The advantages of accepted scientific procedures can never be proved scientifically, but only demonstrated by the common experience that, on the whole, they are better adapted to delivering the goods than alternative approaches. (Hayek, 180)\n",
    "Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, has very similar things to say about programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "When we start, we rarely know the problem well. We often think we do... but we don't. Only a combination of thinking about the problem (analysis) and experimentation (design and implementation) gives us the solid understanding that we need to write a good program... It is rare to find that we had anticipated everything when we analyzed the problem and made the initial design. We should take advantage of the feedback that writing code and testing give us (Stroustrup, 178).\n",
    "Given that competition is a discovery procedure, and thus we can't ever predict, with certainty, the results of market competition, Hayek considers what sort of predictions economists can make, if any? After all, if economics is a science, we expect it to say at least something about the course of events. Hayek concludes that:\n",
    "\n",
    "[The theory of the market's] capacity to predict is necessarily limited to predicting the kind of pattern, or the abstract character of the order that will form itself, but does not extend to the prediction of particular facts. (Hayek, 181)\n",
    "Similarly, in software development, although we can't anticipate in advance exactly what lines of code will be needed... or development would be done!... we can anticipate that good software will exhibit certain patterns. And thus we see Hayek anticipating the \"pattern language\" approach to software development that was imported from the architectural works of Christopher Alexander into software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us turn aside from contemplating the market order, upon which Hayek focuses most of his attention, and consider the other order Hayek mentions: science. Although any scientific enterprise involves planning, we cannot possibly plan out in advance what discoveries we will make in the course of some scientific research: if we knew those, we would have already discovered them, and our research would be done: we would just be writing up the results. But that is precisely what the waterfall model supposes: we already know what the software in question must do: development is complete, and all that remains is to turn the requirements into an executable program: essentially, just \"writing up the results.\" This approach actually blocks the process of discovery, as it leaves no room for the developers or the users to achieve new realizations in the process of turning the blueprint into working code, realizations that would expose the \"specs,\" the master plan, as being based upon false hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect of recognizing an order as a discovery procedure is the implication that where in an organization the most relevant discoveries will be made is also not predictable in advance. Many scientific discoveries have been made because a lab assistant failed to follow some accepted procedure, or noticed something her \"betters\" had missed. And many successful market innovations arose at the level of the factory floor or the sales visit, and not in the executive suite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The waterfall model assumes that every insight about the proper form of the final software product will come from the \"analysts,\" and that it is the job of \"the workers,\" such as programmers, to simply turn those insights into executable code. In this respect, the waterfall model has much in common with \"Taylorism,\" the blueprint for mass production pioneered by Frederick Taylor around the turn of the last century. As Jerry Muller describes it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Taylorism was based on trying to replace the implicit knowledge of the workmen with mass production methods developed, planned, monitored, and controlled by managers. 'Under scientific management,' [Taylor] wrote, 'the managers assume... the burden of gathering together all the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying, tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, formulae... Thus all of the planning which under the old system was done by the workmen, must of necessity under the new system be done by management in accordance with the laws of science. (Muller, pp.32-33)\n",
    "But Taylorism and similar top-down approaches proved inadequate in manufacturing, as demonstrated by the triumph of the Toyota Production System, just as top-down planning failed in the Soviet Union, and just as it does in science. Perhaps their most important piece of wisdom contained in the Lean / Agile / DevOps movement is that the waterfall model of software development fails for very similar reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we recognize software development is a discovery procedure, it should prove useful to categorize some of the features of a program that are most likely to be discovered in the actual process of development, rather than having been perfectly anticipated in our initial analysis of our users' requirements. What I offer here is only intended as an initial cut at what surely is a much more extensive list that could be developed. With that caveat in mind, in the process of actually developing software, here are some likely areas where our initial analysis will fall short of the mark:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discover \"corner solutions\" we had not anticipated. Corner solutions are extreme cases that are not easy to detect in the analysis phase, such as a buyer who has purchased every single product the company sells (what do we market to her?), or a security the price of which has dropped to zero (were we dividing by that price at some point?).\n",
    "Some aspect of the user interface that was \"obvious\" to the designers will appear completely obscure to the actual users: we won't know this until we put some working software in front of them.\n",
    "A calculation or algorithm that the users thought was adequate to their purposes actually is not: it may have handled a few common cases correctly, but once exposed to real world data, its shortcomings may become obvious.\n",
    "Some part of the system may incur a load that was not anticipated during the analysis phase: a particular feature may be much more popular than was predicted, and the capacity of the components assigned to handle that feature might be swamped.\n",
    "There may be regulatory/legal requirements for the software that the users interviewed by the analysts simply took for granted, the violation of which will only become apparent when those users are faced with a working version of the software.\n",
    "\"Black swan\" events will arise in the course of development: a market crash, a new, unforeseen law, a brand-new market emerging, a natural disaster, or a security threat. When we delay as many decisions to as late a time as possible, rather than trying to make all significant choices up front in an \"analysis phase,\" we are far more flexible in responding to such events. As Nassim Taleb wrote, \"once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds -- so those who delay developing their theories are better off\" (Taleb, 144).\n",

    "GitHub, on the other hand, is a web site that allows for free storage of public repositories (\"repos\" for short). It is not necessary to use GitHub in order to use git: some companies have a \"origin\" repo they keep internally, while other people use other public sites, such as BitBucket, to hold the origin version of their repo.

    " Lesson 1: Why Automate Our Builds?\n",
    "\n",
    "Building software is often a complex process. A single software \"product\" may be composed of hundreds or thousands of parts, some created by one team, some created by another, some open-source software products, and some proprietary software provided by some vendor. All of these parts must be \"assembled\" correctly in order to create the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as in every other process DevOps touches, as DevOps practitioners we seek to automate everything. Why? Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeatedly performing such a process by hand is boring.\n",
    "Repeatedly performing such a process by hand is, especially since it is boring, error prone.\n",
    "By automating such a process, we can ensure the inclusion of steps like automated testing and security checks, which are likely to be left out, at least on occasion, if the process is performed manually.\n",
    "The scripts that automate such a process also serve to document it, and in a fashion such that the documentation cannot fall behind the actual process, since it is the actual process!\n",
    " Lesson 2: Build Tools Comparison\n",
    "Build tools are programs that automate the creating of the various products involved in some project. Whenever some \"product\" is constructed by some program(s) from various components that are combined into that product, we should employ a build tool to automate that combining, rather than building that product by running a series of commands \"by hand.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing built may be a complete program, a portion of a program, documentation, a book, a database configuration, a Docker container: in short, whenever some component of a system we are working on is composed of sub-components, we should seek to automate the building of that component with a build tool.\n",

    " Lesson 3: Make\n",
    "For our class, we will use make as our build tool. Although there are more modern tools with additional features, make is sufficient for our purposes because:\n",
    "\n",
    "make is widely available on all UNIX-based systems.\n",
    "make allows us to explore the automation of builds in a way that is quite enough for an introduction to such tools.\n",
    "make executes makefiles. The basic structure of a makefile is:\n",
    "\n",
    "A target, that we seek to build.\n",
    "A list of dependencies, upon which that target depends; and\n",
    "A series of commands to be run, in order to build that target from its dependencies.\n",
    "A key aspect of make's behavior is that it examines the time at which the target and its dependencies were last updated in order to \"decide\" whether to execute the commands that build the target from its dependencies. If the timestamp on the target file is newer than any of those on the dependency files, make will \"judge\" that the target is up-to-date, and does not need to be rebuilt.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second crucial aspect of make's behavior is that, when it is building a target by executing one or more commands, should any of those commands fail (return a non-zero exit code), make will stop trying to build that target and report the error. It is this feature of make that allows us to insert automated tests into a build, and halt the build should any of those tests fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having examined the logic of a makefile, let us look at an actual instance of one, from one of our projects:\n",

    "\n",
    "The Seven Wastes\n",
    "A key source of DevOps ideas is the Toyota Production System. In particular, the people at Toyota thinking deeply about production identified seven wastes that should be eliminated in any production process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overproduction: Don't produce more than the customers need at present! Such overproduction may never prove useful. The system you are building might possibly come to include, say, the ability to feed the data it produces to a neural network. But is any customer asking for this? No? Then wait until they are asking to produce it!\n",
    "Inventory: Do not pile up partially done work. The aim of production is to deliver finished work to the customer. Partially done work is continually at risk of being rendered otiose by changes in circumstance. Furthermore, all partially done work is a constant drain on the scarce attention of the workers involved: a worker with one partially finished task can focus on that task. A worker with ten partially finished tasks will wind up \"thrashing\" between those tasks.\n",
    "Waiting: Avoid having people (or products) lying idle waiting for someone else to finish some work. If each work station along the way in some process works in small batches, that minimizes the amount of waiting likely to occur at other work stations.\n",
    "Motion: A production process should minimize the movement of producers and products: for example, don't make programmers fork a repo, work on it, and submit a pull request, if you can trust them to contribute directly to the repo.\n",
    "Transportation: If a programmer can directly ask the end user if their work is OK, don't instead make them go through approval by the project manager, the CIO, the user's manager, and the user's nanny, to see if they can release it.\n",
    "Rework: Get the work right the first time! A key to this is to work in small batches. Trying to make five major changes to a system all at once, in order to \"save time\", is only likely to result in amounts of subsequent rework that will more than wipe out the supposed \"time savings\" of the all-at-once approach.\n",
    "Overprocessing: The waste of doing things the customer does not need to have done, for instance, building high-level security into an app that no is trying to hack into.\n",
    " Lesson 2: Work in Small Batches\n",
    "An essential part of the Toyota Production System was to work in small batches. That allowed Toyota to respond rapidly to changing customer demand, because it did not have huge inventory backlogs it had to get rid of before changing course. Eric Ries, entrepreneur, tech executive, and coder, writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there are tremendous benefits from working with a batch size radically smaller than traditional practice suggests. In my experience, a few hours of coding is enough to produce a viable batch and is worth checking in and deploying.\n",
    "My experience completely agrees with Eric's: I often check in code, and deploy it into production, once an hour. Why are small batches so important? Let's look at the reasons Eric lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Small batches mean faster feedback.\n",
    "Small batches mean problems are instantly localized.\n",
    "Small batches reduce risk.\n",

    "Part of this is establishing a culture of trust: If we need to feed approval for each change through multiple levels of bureaucracy, we can't fix bugs right away.

    "\n",
    "Infrastructure as code: What is it? Why is it important? \n",
    "(This is a fantastic 3 minute explanation of the value of Infrastructure as Code.)\n",
    "Infrastructure as code (IaC) as the idea that, rather than manually provisioning servers, or setting up hardware through a point-and-click GUI, the \"server room\" should itself be managed by code. That code can then be put under version control, tested, deployed with automated build tools, and so on. The code also serves as necessarily up-to-date documentation of what the infrastructure is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of IaC can be divided into three main categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost savings: By automating hardware provisioning, the time of the people who would have been doing that by hand is freed up for other tasks.\n",
    "Speed of deployment: It is much faster to configure infrastructure by running a script than by manually setting a bunch of parameters in a GUI interface.\n",
    "Lower error rates: It is error-prone, because it is boring, too configure systems \"by hand.\" A script can be debugged once, and then will run reliably again and again. Furthermore, as code, the infrastructure can be read and reasoned about. It is very hard to do that with a bunch of check-boxes!\n",

    "To set up a local version of a web server that will be configured \"just like\" our production server. (\"Just like\" is in quotes because that is always the ideal, but it may not be fully achieved.)\n",
    "To provide our full suite of development tools, such as the correct Python version, make, flake8, various Python libraries, etc., in one simple to build package, so all developer's have a consistent environment.\n",
    "Ultimately, we should be deploying the container where we locally test our web servers right into production, guaranteeing that development and production are identical environments. Unfortunately, at the moment, the places we are hosting do not support that. We are exploring other options.\n",
    "So we need to know how to create the right container for each project. Each project we work on should have a Dockerfile consisting of instructions on how to build the image for that project, a requirements.txt listing what external modules need to be included in the image, and a line in the project's makefile automating the build of the image. This is infrastructure as code, since the infrastructure for the project is built from these files of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the makefile we want something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "container: $(DOCKER_DIR)/Dockerfile $(DOCKER_DIR)/requirements.txt \n",
    "        docker build -t indra docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a sample Dockerfile. \n",
    "The FROM python:3.6.0 command says what base image to build our image from. \n",
    "The COPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt line brings the requirements file inside the container. \n",
    "The line RUN pip install -r requirements.txt installs everything from the requirements file in the container. \n",
    "The line ENV user_type TERMINAL sets an environment variable (user_type) that will be available inside the container. \n",
    "WORKDIR /home/IndrasNet/ sets the starting directory inside the container.\n",
    "Here is the requirements file it uses.\n",
    " Our More Advanced Docker Usage\n",
    "In the Online DevOps course project, we use a more advanced Docker setup: we employ Docker Compose to define and run an application composed of more than one Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker Compose use a YAML file to specify the configuration of a multi-container Docker app.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Online DevOps course setup, we are running just two containers: one to run the MySQL database, and the other to run our Django web server. But other Docker Compose setups might include a web server, a load balancer, a database, an authentication server, and more! \n",

    "SQL Injection\n",
    "\"A SQL Injection attack consists of insertion or \"injection\" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert /Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands.\" \n",

    "\n",
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n",
    "\"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it. XSS can be used by an attacker to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.\" \n",

    "\n",
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)\n",
    "\"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.\" \n",
    "-www.owasp.org\n",
    "\n",
    "Command Injection\n",
    "\"Command injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.\" \n",

    "\"A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files. It should be noted that access to files is limited by system operational access control (such as in the case of locked or in-use files on the Microsoft Windows operating system).\" \n",

Web applications make use of serialization and deserialization on a regular basis and most programming languages even provide native features to serialize data (especially into common formats like JSON and XML). It’s frequently possible for an attacker to abuse these deserialization features when the application is deserializing untrusted data which the attacker controls. Successful insecure deserialization attacks could allow an attacker to carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, authentication bypasses, and remote code execution attacks.\" \n",

    "Delivering IT services via the Cloud be is a time saver, but it has a downside: the security of those services. Clouds provide these services by relying on virtualization technology. While virtualization reduces some security risks, others are increased because the attack surface in a cloud service is greater. The risks can be broadly categorised into hypervisor security, network security, data security (in transit and at rest), security of monitoring and incident response.\n",

    "An introduction to DevSecOps or rugged DevOps \n",
    "Rugged DevOps is the practice of shifting Security left. Security teams can introduce security much earlier in the development process. This is contrary to the standard approach where security practices of code analysis and vulnerability testing is placed just before the application is deployed into production.\n",
    "DevSecOps: Including Security in Software Life cycle \n",

    "Performing a Automated/Manual penetration testing in SDLC can help to find vulnerability at early stage of development and reduce the threat to the system. Its good to work in tandem with penetration testing team to build a robust security posture.\n",
    "DevOps: Performing a Network Penetration Testing \n",
    "Performing a Network or Infrastructure based penetration testing helps to identify the weak links inside the network components such as Servers, it also detects presence/absence of firewalls, NIDS/HIDS, vulnerable ports and services running on them. The early detection and mitigation of these vulnerabilities can help an organisation to build a robust and secure infrastructure. NMAP is an important tools to scan ports and find vulnerable services running on a server.\n",
    "DevOps: Secure Coding Practice \n",
    "Enforcing a secure coding practice makes a programme/application resistant to malicious attackers or potentially malicious programmes. Implementing such practices in DevOps can help to build a robust security posture right from the beginning. This link enumerates top 10 best practice which any organisation following a devops practice should follow.\n",
    "DevOps: 5 best practices for integrating security into your DevOps \n",
    "These five best practice can help to integrate security features in SDLC within DevOps practice. It entails fast and efficient way to cultivate security and has an edge over traditional way of implementing security.\n",
    "DevOps: Cloud Security in DevOps \n",
    "Cloud security is paramount in DevOps culture since most of the organisation is preferring to host off-premises services. This book provides the best way to provide security at SaaS,IaaS,PaaS services.\n",

    " Lesson 1: Microsoft's DevOps Tools\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure DevOps, Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure DevOps, Part II\n",
    "Below are the key DevOps ideas that Denis presented, with some commentary as to how they relate to other material presented in our course:\n",
    "\n",
    "Small releases \n",
    "This is our incremental development idea stated a little differently. The result of adopting this practice is almost magical: whereas previously, you may have found yourself doing an eight-hour coding spree, and then testing and correcting bugs for another 20 hours, you will find that 12 one-hour sessions, each aimed to get a tiny part of your software working, will get the same amount of work done as the 8-hour session... but will be followed by 20 minutes of debugging.\n",
    "Everything as code \n",
    "Infrastructure as code is a part of this principle. But also, your tests should be code (pytest), and your code reviews should be code (flake8), and your builds should be code (make).\n",
    "Use components \n",
    "This is an extension of the UNIX tool philosophy, which over many years led to the idea of microservices. The basic idea is the code that has the fewest bugs and the minimum development time is the code you don't have to write, since somebody else already wrote it!\n",
    "Automate everything you can \n",
    "Automating routine workflows allows us to:\n",
    "Turn them into code that itself can be put under version control and tested.\n",
    "Remove the drudgery of these repeated tasks from humans and assign it to machines.\n",
    "Document these workflows through the very code that automates them.\n",
    "Zero-bug mindset \n",
    "When we embrace the idea of (very) small releases, and adopt automated testing, there is no need for us to have any \"bug backlog\" at all: the automated tests should catch most problems, and anything they miss, since our release was a very small addition to the previous code, will be easy to track down.\n",
    "Develop resilience (be anti-fragile!) \n",
    "Nassim Taleb teaches in Tandon's finance department. He has developed the idea of anti-fragility. An application of that idea is Netflix's Chaos Monkey tool, part of its Simian Army toolkit.\n",
    "Use cloud services \n",
    "This is really an extension of the \"Use components\" idea: why manage your own server room when there are pros at managing server rooms who will sell you their expertise at a reasonable cost?\n",

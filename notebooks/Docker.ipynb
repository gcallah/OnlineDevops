    "Prior to the rise of containers, the common way to package and deliver an application to the cloud was inside a [virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) (VM). There are systems, like [Vagrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_(software), that allow specifying the configuration of virtual machines through code (IAC). There are aslo tools like [Ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)), [Chef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_(software)), or [Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software)), that will help to configure virtual machines."

    "\n",
    "cgroups, short for \"control groups,\" limit a process, and all of its children, to certain amounts of CPU, memory, and network bandwith, and particular namespaces and devices on the system. When we kick off a Docker container, it runs within a cgroup that limits what it can do.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that partitions kernel resources such that one set of processes sees one set of resources while another set of processes sees a different set of resources. The feature works by having the same name space for these resources in the various sets of processes, but those names referring to distinct resources. Examples of resource names that can exist in multiple spaces, so that the named resources are partitioned, are process IDs, hostnames, user IDs, file names, and some names associated with network access, and interprocess communication.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "### Union File System \n",

    "As Wikipedia has it, \"In computer operating systems, union mounting is a way of combining multiple directories into one that appears to contain their combined contents.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "UNIX and Linux filesystems are themselves files. To access them, they must be mounted at some point under the root directory. If we mount two directories at the same mount point, one after another, we will only find the contents of the second there. But if we union mount them, we will have the union of the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Union mounting is how Docker builds up your image from multiple layers of docker images. That means you don't have to start from scratch every time you want to make an image. And containers can share files until one of them writes to one, at which point that file will be moved from the read-only shared area to the read-write layer specific to that container.\n",

    "The Netlink socket family is a Linux kernel interface used for inter-process communication (IPC) between both the kernel and userspace processes, and between different userspace processes, in a way similar to the Unix domain sockets.

    "\n",
    "Netfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that allows various networking-related operations to be implemented in the form of customized handlers. Netfilter offers various functions and operations for packet filtering, network address translation, and port translation, which provide the functionality required for directing packets through a network and prohibiting packets from reaching sensitive locations within a network. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter)"

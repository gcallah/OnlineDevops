						Some History

					<h2>
						An Accidental Name
					</h2>
					<p>As development teams adopted Lean and Agile methods, they often became capable of producing production-ready software on a daily basis, or even more frequently. But managing software in production environments was traditionally the job of operations, not of the developers. And operations viewed its job as slowing the pace of releases, because releases meant bugs, crashes, and other problems operations had to handle.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>How could this gulf between development and operations be narrowed? Operations itself had to become Lean and Agile! In particular, rather than hand-provisioning operations infrastructure, operations team members had to themselves become coders, and apply the full toolkit of Lean and Agile methods to operations: incremental changes, automated testing, source code control, automated builds, and so on. One of those operations people, Patrick Debois, named a conference DevOpsDays, and from that seed, the term "DevOps" spread.</p>

					<h2>
						Why Incremental Development?
					</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Small batches of work make testing easier.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Easier to find a bug when you have one.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Enables rapid feedback from the users on whether the software is delivering what they want.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Allows us to deliver value to the user more rapidly.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Small batches are more satisfying to the developers, because their software gets used soon after they write it.</li>
						</ul>
						
				</section>
				<section>
				<p>Completing and delivering small batches of work at a time is such an important part of DevOps that we could almost say that every other part of DevOps exists to enable frequent, reliable delivery of small improvements to a piece of software.</p>

					<h2>
						Infrastructure as Code
					</h2>
					<p>
						Infrastructure as code (IaC) as the idea that, rather than manually provisioning servers, or setting up hardware through a point-and-click GUI, the "server room" should itself be managed by code. That code can then be put under version control, tested, deployed with automated build tools, and so on. The code also serves as necessarily up-to-date documentation of what the infrastructure is.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The advantages of IaC can be divided into three main categories:</p>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">Cost savings</li>
						<li class="fragment">Speed of deployment</li>
						<li class="fragment">Lower error rates</li>
					</ul>

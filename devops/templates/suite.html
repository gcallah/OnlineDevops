            <p>
                Here we have Denis Petelin presenting, first, his understanding
                of what DevOps is, and secondly, how the Microsoft
                toolkit offers end-to-end support for good DevOps practices:

                Below are the key DevOps ideas that Denis presented, with some
                commentary as to how they relate to other material presented in
                our course:

                    </span>
                    <br />
                    This is our
                    incremental development
                    idea stated a little differently. The result of adopting
                    this practice is almost magical: whereas previously, you
                    may have found yourself doing an eight-hour coding spree,
                    and then testing and correcting bugs for another 20 hours,
                    you will find that 12 one-hour sessions, each aimed to get
                    a tiny part of your software working, will get the same
                    amount of work done as the 8-hour session... but will be
                    followed by 20 <i>minutes</i> of debugging.

                    is a
                    part of this principle. But also, your tests should be
                    code (<code>pytest</code>),
                    and your code reviews should be code (<code>flake8</code>),
                    and your builds should be code (<code>make</code>).

                    <br />
                    This is an extension of the UNIX tool philosophy, which
                    over many years led to the idea of
                    <a href=" {% url 'devops:micro' %}">
                        microservices.
                    </a>
                    The basic idea is the code that has the fewest bugs
                    and the minimum development time is the code you don't have
                    to write, since somebody else already wrote it!

                    </span>
                    <br />
                    Automating routine workflows allows us to:

                    <ol class="inner_nested">
                        <li>
                            Turn them into code that itself can be put under
                            version control and tested.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Remove the drudgery of these repeated tasks
                            from humans and assign it to machines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Document these workflows through the very code
                            that automates them.
                        </li>

                    <br />
                    When we embrace the idea of (very) small releases, and
                    adopt automated testing, there is no need for us to have
                    any "bug backlog" at all: the automated tests should catch
                    most problems, and anything they miss, since our release
                    was a very small addition to the previous code, will be
                    easy to track down.

                    This is really an extension of the "Use components"

            <p>
                Microsoft Azure, as a part of its push towards the DevOps
                philosophy, provides services aimed at increasing productivity
                through deep integrations on its platform. The main aim is to
                enable continous development (CD) of our production software
                and continuous integration (CI) of updates to the same. We
                explore various services provided by Microsoft below:

                    <br />
                    Boards is a project management service offered by
                    Microsoft aimed at integrating the development activity
                    using  easy-to-use interface. Boards is primarily based on
                    the Kanban system, originally designed for lean
                    manufacturing by Toyota. Apart from tracking progress from
                    "idea to release", Boards allows for scheduling of  stand-
                    ups, sprints and planning meetings. Boards allows for
                    CI/CD though a feature called Backlogs which allows for
                    dynamic addition of user stories and requirements to
                    product backlog. This feature, when coupled with Scrum and
                    Kanban boards, can dramatically improve productivity and
                    ease the workflow.

                    <br />
                    Artifacts allow package management using existing CI/CD
                    pipelines to enable efficient code sharing across
                    different teams in an organization. Support exists to use
                    npm, Maven and NuGet package managers. A new feature
                    introduced by Microsoft, called Universal Package allows
                    developers to bundle multiple files such as database
                    snapshots, machine learning models, developer tools, 3D
                    models and configuration scripts. Microsoft's compression
                    technology allows savings of 10:1 in network transfers and
                    storage utilization. Native integration with existing
                    CI/CD pipelines enables quick integration in existing
                    projects and production code.

                    Azure DevTest Labs is a service that helps developers
                    and testers quickly create environments in Azure while
                    minimizing waste and controlling cost. You can test the
                    latest version of your application by quickly provisioning
                    Windows and Linux environments using reusable templates and
                    artifacts. Easily integrate your deployment pipeline with
                    DevTest Labs to provision on-demand environments. Scale up
                    your load testing by provisioning multiple test agents, and
                    create pre-provisioned environments for training and demos.

                    <br />
                    Azure Pipelines helps you implement a build, test, and
                    deployment pipeline for any app.You can use Azure
                    Pipelines to build an app written in any language. You can
                    either use YAML to define your pipelines or use the visual
                    designer to do the same.

                    When you use YAML, you define your pipeline mostly in code
                    (a YAML file) alongside the rest of the code for your app.
                    When you use the visual designer, you define a build
                    pipeline to build and test your code, and then to publish
                    artifacts. You also define a release pipeline to consume
                    and deploy those artifacts to deployment targets.

                    Steps to Use Azure Pipelines with YAML
                    <br>
                    You can configure your pipelines in a YAML file that
                    exists alongside your code.

                      <li>Your code is now updated, built, tested, and packaged.

                    Repos provides cloud hosted private Git repos accessible
                    through IDEs, web interfaces and any Git client. It
                    supports web hooks and API integration using REST

                    search code semantically. This enables searching through

                    Azure Repos offers cloud-hosted private and public Git repos.
                    It offers collaborative code reviews to improve the quality
                    of the code and increase the knowledge of the code base
                    across the team. Azure Repos also allows you to manage
                    access to the code repositories. It is possible to assign
                    granular permissions to users and groups. Azure Repos
                    provides semantic code search which is a code-aware search
                    that understands classes and variables.

                    exploratory testing solutions. Kanban boards are used to
                    add, view, interact with test cases and progressively
                    monitor the status. Azure Test Plans also let you organise
                    tests into test plans and test suites. The test suites can
                    be dynamic or static. Runners can be used to test apps on
                    any platform. The bugs filed during the process will
                    include the diagnostic data automatically.

            The <i>Twelve-Factor App</i> is a method for creating portable,
            rapidly deployable, and easily maintainable software-as-a-service
            apps that can live in the cloud.
        </p>

                I. Codebase
            </summary>
            <p>
                There is one codebase per app, and it contains all of the code
                for that app. Shared code across apps is held in libraries that
                are recorded as dependencies for the app.
            </p>

            <p>
                The entire codebase, including all versions, are stored in a
                version control system. Deployments of the app are done from
                this version control <i>repository</i>. While there is a single
                codebase, there may be many versions in the codebase, deployed
                to development, staging, acceptance testing, and production. We
                might even have A/B versions out in production simultaneously,
                to test new features.
            </p>

            </summary>

            <p>
                The Twelve-Factor App should not have hidden or implicit
                dependencies. For our Python servers, we achieve this by:
            </p>

            <ol class="nested">
                <li>
                    Putting all packages needed for running the server in
                    <i>requirements.txt</i> and for developing it in
                    <i>requirements-dev.txt</i>, and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Running the server in a
                    <i>virtualenv</i> that contains just those packages.
                    <br />
                    (Note: we should set up developer envs with virtualenv as
                    well.)
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                A great benefit of this explicit declaration of dependencies is
                that we can set up new developers quickly:
            </p>
            <ol class="nested">
                <li>
                    git clone the repo; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
                </li>
            </ol>

                III. Config
            </summary>

            <p>
                "Config," or <i>configuration</i>, should be done through
                environment variables, rather than (separate or changing)
                configuration files.
            </p>

            <p>
                The problem with changing a configuration file to, say, use a
                local web server instead of the production one, is that
                changing code risks:
            </p>

            <ol class="nested">
                <li>
                    Introducing a typo which breaks something; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    Forgetting to set the web server back to prod, which breaks
                    everything.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The problem with alternate configuration files is that, as the
                app grows more complex and more combinations of services are
                needed, for example, run the developer's Javascript code
                against the production API server but a staging database, the
                number of config files undergoes a combinatorial explosion.
                Environment variables do not have this problem: there is just
                one setting for each service, file location, etc.

            <p>
                <i>Backing services</i> are things like databases, cache
                managers, mail services, authentication services (like SAML),
                and messaging systems. These services should be swappable, and
                the app should be indifferent as to whether they are a local
                service or a third-party service: they should all be accessed
                via a URL stored in the <i>config</i>.

            <p>
                We should separate the <i>build</i>, <i>release</i>, and
                <i>run</i> aspects of our app as strictly as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                In our applications, we build by running <i>make prod</i> on
                the developer's machine. We release through Travis-CI passing
                the build and pushing it to PythonAnywhere. We can re-run the
                app at anytime through the PythonAnywhere web interface.

            <p>
                We should prefer, as far as possible, to run our app in
                stateless processes. Things like web "sessions" (which we can
                detect when we leave a web page up for a few minutes and learn
                "Your session has timed out") should be avoided. Each new
                interaction with our app should carry all of the information
                needed to carry out the necessary processing, even if our app
                has been re-booted in the meantime.

            <p>
                We scale our app by running additional processes. This is much
                simpler than adding threads inside a process, and relies on the
                OSs (already debugged) multitasking.

            <p>
                We want the parts of our app to start up quickly and shut down
                gracefully (not leave any work half done). Quick start up is
                important, for instance, if we release a new server, discover a
                serious bug, and need to roll back to the previous version or
                deploy a new version with the bug fixed. A quick start up
                assures minimal down time.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to be able to bring down servers deliberately, or even
                have them crash, without disrupting service. (Think of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_engineering">Chaos Monkey</a>.)

                <li>
                    The tool gap is small: as far as possible, the developer
                    works on the same stack as exists in production. (Question:
                    How do we do this for a PAAS like PythonAnywhere?)

            <p>
                Logs should be treated as streams to which are
                fed reports of significant events as they occur.
                Writing logs to standard output is very flexible:
                the developer on her laptop can watch the flow of events right
                on her screen. In production, standard output can be
                captured by the process that runs the server and can be
                re-directed as needed, into a file, or perhaps into a log
                aggregator. In the latter case, multiple servers providing
                microservices can all feed the same log, giving a better
                picture of the overall state of the system than would
                individual logs.

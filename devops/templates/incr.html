                <li>
                    Small batches make it easier to find a bug when you have
                    one.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Small batches enable rapid feedback from the users on
                    whether the software is delivering what they want.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Small batches allow us to deliver value to the user more
                    rapidly.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Small batches are more satisfying to the developers, 
                    because they get to see their software being used soon 
                    after they write it.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Completing and delivering small batches of work at a time is
                such an important part of DevOps that we could almost say that
                every other part of DevOps exists to enable
                <i>frequent, reliable</i>
                delivery of small improvements to a piece of software.
            </p>

            <p>
                In older models of software development, it was thought that
                rapid delivery of software to users meant buggy systems that 
                crashed a lot.

                Lesson 2: Version control everything
            </summary>

            <p>
                <i>Version control</i> is the name for tools that allow
                the storing of different versions of project files, and the
                ability to revert to an earlier version (for instance, when a
                bug is found in the new version).
                There are a variety of version control systems in existence,
                such as <code>RCS</code>, <code>SCCS</code>,
                <code>Suberversion</code>, <code>CVS</code>,
                and <code>git</code>.
                You should study the page on version control
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">here</a>.

                Lesson 3: git and GitHub
            </summary>

            <p>
                First things first: don't confuse <code>git</code> with
                GitHub! <code>git</code> is a system for creating and updating
                a distributed source code control
                <a href="gloss/">repository</a>. It includes features
                for adding new files, updating files, deleting files or
                versions from the repository, branching, resolving 
                version conflicts, and reverting to earlier versions.
            </p>

            <p>
                GitHub, on the other hand, is a web site that allows for free
                storage of public repositories ("repos" for short).
                It is not necessary to use GitHub in order to use
                <code>git</code>: some companies have a "origin" repo they keep
                internally, while other people use other public sites, such as
                <a href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>,
                to hold the origin version of their repo. (We, in fact, will
                explore moving to BitBucket during our course.)
            </p>

            <p>
                You will only need a small number of <code>git</code> commands
                for most of our work.
                (You can also use <code>git</code> from 
                GitHub Desktop, but it is good to be at least a little
                familiar with command line usage.)
                In particular, you need to know:
            </p>

            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    <code>git clone
                        https://github.com/gcallah/OnlineDevops.git
                    </code>
                    <br />
                    This makes a local copy of a repo from an online
                    copy. The online copy becomes the <i>origin</i>
                    repo for the local copy.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code>
                    <br />
                    Adds &lt;filename&gt; to the repo.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>git commit &lt;filename&gt; -m "Message"</code>
                    <br />
                    Commits changes to &lt;filename&gt; into the repo,
                    labeled with "Message". <b>Note</b>: Commit messages
                    are important! They let your teammates know why a
                    new version of the file has been created.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>git push origin master</code>
                    <br />
                    This pushes the master branch of your code to the origin
                    repo. (Some projects create multiple branches: following
                    the guidelines for <i>continuous delivery</i>, we will not
                    be doing that.) You run this when you are ready to share
                    your work with your team: that should happen frequently!
                    Several pushes per hour is not unusual.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>git pull origin master</code>
                    <br />
                    This is how you refresh your local repo with the work
                    others have been doing. You should certainly do this to
                    start your work day, and if you know others are working at
                    the same time, perhaps more often.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>git rm &lt;filename&gt; </code>
                    <br />
                    This removes &lt;filename&gt; from the repo
                    <i>and</i> your local file system. You should always 
                    delete files through <code>git</code> and not using your
                    native OS's capabilities.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <code>git mv &lt;old_filename&gt;
                        &lt;new_filename&gt;</code>
                    <br />
                    This renames &lt;old_filename&gt; to &lt;new_filename&gt;.
                    You should always 
                    rename files through <code>git</code> and not using your
                    native OS's capabilities.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <code>git</code> is a <i>distributed</i> version control
                system. This is important to understand for a couple of
                reasons:
            </p>

            <ol class="nested">
                <li>
                    Using <code>git</code> one can work entirely offline,
                    and continue checking code into the repo: each person
                    who has cloned the repo has a full copy of it.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Understanding many of the problems one will hit while
                    using <code>git</code> is easier knowing this: typically, 
                    problems arise when to copies of the repo get out
                    of sync, and <code>git</code> has trouble re-syncing
                    them.
                </li>

            </ol>

            <p>
                The final aspect of <code>git</code> we will discuss
                here is submodules. They are a method of incorporating
                one repo within another one.

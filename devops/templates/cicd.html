                Lesson 1: What Is CI/CD?
            </summary>
            <p>
                CI and CD are two acronyms that are often mentioned when people talk about modern development practices.Continuous
                integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) embody a culture, set of operating principles, and collection of
                practices that enable application development teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably. The
                implementation is also known as the CI/CD pipeline and is one of the best practices for devops teams to implement.
            </p>
            <h5>CI : Continuous Integration</h5>
            <p>
                Continuous Integration can be explained as: you want all parts of what goes into making your application go to
                the same place and run through the same processes with results published to an easy to access place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once all the code and changes start going to the same place, you can run some processes on that
                repository every time something changes. These processes can include:
                <li>
                    Running automatic code quality tests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Building the code and running automated tests.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                These simple additions allows the developer to focus on writing the code. The central repository of code is there to
                receive your changes while automated processes can build, test, and scan the code while providing reports.
            </p>
            <h5>CD : Continuous Delivery</h5>
            <p>
                Continuous delivery picks up where continuous integration ends. CD automates the delivery of applications to selected
                infrastructure environments. Most teams work with multiple environments other than the production, such as development
                and testing environments, and CD ensures there is an automated way to push code changes to them.  CD automation then
                performs any necessary service calls to web servers, databases, and other services that may need to be restarted or
                follow other procedures when applications are deployed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many free tools available which let's you employ CI/CD easily, such as Travis CI or Jenkins.

                Lesson 1: What Is CI/CD?
            </summary>
            <p>
                Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) 
                are a pair of practices that, when done properly, greatly aid
                an organization's ability to deliver software frequently and
                reliably to its customers.
                We often hear the combination of these practices referred to 
                as "the CI/CD pipeline," and they are among the most important
                practices a DevOps team can implement.
                So what do these practices consist of?
            </p>

            <h5>CI : Continuous Integration</h5>

            <p>
                Continuous Integration means that every developer should be
                pushing code to the master branch regularly, at the minimum
                once per day, and that then that code should be tested to
                ensure that it <i>integrates</i> with all the other code
                currently in the master branch. The practice of continuous
                integration eliminates the huge "integration" phase that
                tyoically took place in waterfall model projects, where
                developers would work on isolated pockets of code for months
                or even a year or more, and only try to join their code to
                other teams' code at the very end of the project.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                On a push to the master branch, various processes can be
                launched, such as:
            </p>

            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    Running automatic code quality tests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Building an executable from the code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reporting on code testing coverage.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Building a docker container that can be used
                    to deploy the code.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                These simple additions allows the developer to focus on writing
                the code. The central repository of code is there to receive
                your changes while automated processes can build, test, and
                scan the code while providing reports.
            </p>

            <h5>CD : Continuous Delivery</h5>

            <p>
                Continuous delivery means taking the result of the continuous
                integration process and delivering it to a "place" in which it
                can be run. That "place" my be a test server, a staging server,
                or even production. If the continuous delivery phase is
                actually putting the new software right into production, then
                it also qualifies as "continuous deployment." It almost goes
                without saying that only teams experienced with CI/CD should
                extend that practice to continuous deployment.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many free tools to aid in CI/CD, such as Travis CI
                and Jenkins, both of which we will discuss below.
            </p>

                Lesson 2: Jenkins
            </summary>
            <p>
                Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java.
                It aids the adoption of CI/CD because through WebHooks, Jenkins
                can be triggered by, for instance, a push to GitHub. Upon being
                triggered, Jenkins can directly, or through plugins, run a wide
                variety of processes that can test, package, document, analyze
                and deploy your application.
            </p>

            <h5>Advantages of Jenkins</h5>
                <ul class="nested">
                <li>It is an open source tool with great community support.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It has 1000+ plugins to ease your work. If a plugin does
                not exist, you can code it and share with the community.
                </li>
                <li>It is free.</li>
                <li>It is built with Java and hence, it is portable to all
                    major platforms.</li>
                </ul>

                            Jenkins can be installed on various platforms and
                            operating systems. For this demonstration we are
                            using Docker to install Jenkins.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are several Docker images of Jenkins
                            available. The recommended Docker image to use is
                            the jenkinsci/blueocean image (from the Docker Hub
                            repository). This image contains the current
                            Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Jenkins (which
                            is production-ready) bundled with all Blue Ocean
                            plugins and features.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After downloading the jenkins image you can use
                            below docker command to install and run jenkins on
                            docker.

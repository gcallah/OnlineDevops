                        Rugged DevOps is the practice of shifting Security left.
                        Security teams can introduce security much earlier in the
                        development process. This is contrary to the standard
                        approach where security practices of code analysis and
                        vulnerability testing is placed just before the
                        application is deployed into production.

                        Introducing security practices earlier in the software
                        engineering will enable developers to always think of
                        security while developing their application. This will
                        also enable them to come up with creative solutions for
                        enabling security in their applications.

                        DevOps provides a method to have the concept of "Security
                        by Design" integrated into the software engineering
                        lifecycle from the start. It also helps keep security
                        balanced with business objectives.

                        Performing a Automated/Manual penetration testing in
                        SDLC can help to find vulnerability at early stage of

                        Performing a Network or Infrastructure based
                        penetration testing helps to identify the weak links
                        inside the network components such as Servers, it also
                        detects presence/absence of firewalls, NIDS/HIDS,
                        vulnerable ports and services running on them. The
                        early detection and mitigation of these vulnerabilities
                        can help an organisation to build a robust and secure
                        infrastructure. NMAP is an important tools to scan
                        ports and find vulnerable services running on a server.

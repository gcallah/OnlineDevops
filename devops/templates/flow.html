            <p>
                A key source of DevOps ideas is the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System">Toyota Production System</a>.
                In particular, the people at Toyota thinking deeply about
                production identified <span class="hilight">seven wastes</span>
                that should be eliminated in any production process:
            </p>

            <ol class="nested">
                <li>
                    <span class="hilight">Overproduction</span>:
                    Don't produce more than the customers need at present!
                    Such overproduction may never prove useful.
                    The system you are building might possibly come to include,
                    say, the ability to feed the data it produces to a neural
                    network. But is any customer asking for this? No? Then wait
                    until they are asking to produce it!
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hilight">Inventory</span>:
                    Do not pile up partially done work. The aim of production
                    is to deliver <i>finished</i> work to the customer.
                    Partially done work is continually at risk of being
                    rendered otiose by changes in circumstance.
                    Furthermore, all partially done work is a constant drain on
                    the scarce attention of the workers involved: a worker with
                    one partially finished task can focus on that task.
                    A worker with ten partially finished tasks will wind up
                    "thrashing" between those tasks.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hilight">Waiting</span>:
                    Avoid having people (or products) lying idle
                    waiting for someone else to finish some work.
                    If each work station along the way in some process works in
                    small batches, that minimizes the amount of waiting likely
                    to occur at other work stations.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hilight">Motion</span>:
                    A production process should minimize the movement
                    of producers and products: for example, don't make
                    programmers fork a repo, work on it, and submit a pull
                    request, <i>if</i> you can trust them to contribute
                    directly to the repo.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hilight">Transportation</span>:
                    If a programmer can directly ask the end user
                    if their work is OK, don't instead make them go through
                    approval by the project manager, the CIO, the user's
                    manager, and the user's nanny, to see if they can release
                    it.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hilight">Rework</span>:
                    Get the work right the first time! A key to this is to work
                    in small batches. Trying to make five major changes to a
                    system all at once, in order to "save time", is only likely
                    to result in amounts of subsequent rework that will more
                    than wipe out the supposed "time savings" of the
                    all-at-once approach.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="hilight">Overprocessing</span>:
                    The waste of doing things the customer does not need to
                    have done, for instance, building high-level
                    security into an app that no is trying to hack into.

                Lesson 2: Work in Small Batches
            </summary>

            <p>
                An essential part of the Toyota Production System
                was to work in <span class="hilight">small batches</span>.
                That allowed Toyota to respond rapidly to changing customer
                demand, because it did not have huge inventory backlogs
                it had to get rid of before changing course.
                Eric Ries, entrepreneur, tech executive, and coder, writes:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                It turns out that there are tremendous benefits from working
                with a batch size <i>radically smaller</i> than traditional practice
                suggests. In my experience, <i>a few hours</i> of coding is enough to
                produce a viable batch and is worth checking in and deploying.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                My experience completely agrees with Eric's: I often check in
                code, <i>and deploy it into production</i>, once an hour.
                Why are small batches so important? Let's look at the reasons
                Eric lists:
            </p>

            <ul class="nested">
                <li>
                    Small batches mean faster feedback.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Small batches mean problems are instantly localized.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Small batches reduce risk.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Small batches reduce overhead.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                But please read Eric's

                    article</a>!
                This is a very experienced developer, telling us our batch size
                should be <i>radically</i> smaller than most people believe.

                <span class="hilight">Scrum</span> is a method of managing
                software development where a team divides its work into
                <span class="hilight">sprints</span>
                of roughly a couple of weeks, during which
                progress is evaluated in a daily stand-up meeting
                called a <span class="hilight">daily scrum</span>.
